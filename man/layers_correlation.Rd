\alias{layers_correlation}
\title{Gives the Pearson correlation between layers}
\usage{
layers_correlation(layercodes = c(), include_quadratic = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{layercodes}{character vector or dataframe. Codes of the layers you want
the basic statistics of as a character vector or a dataframe with a
"layer_code" column. With the default empty vector all statistics are
returned.}

\item{include_quadratic}{logical. When \code{TRUE}, then the correlation
coefficients of the square of the layercodes area also returned. These
layers are indicated with the layercode with \code{"_quadratic"} as a
suffix, for example \code{"BO_calcite"} became 
\code{"BO_calcite_quadratic"}.}
}
\value{
A dataframe with the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients.
}
\description{
\code{layers_correlations} returns the Pearson product-moment correlation
coefficient (Pearson's r) for every combination of the give layercodes. The
correlation between a terrestrial and a marine layer has been set to
\code{NA}.
}
\examples{
# correlation of the first 10 layers
layers_correlation()[1:10,1:10]
layers_correlation(c("BO_calcite", "MS_bathy_5m"))
layers_correlation(c("BO_calcite", "MS_bathy_5m"), include_quadratic = FALSE)
